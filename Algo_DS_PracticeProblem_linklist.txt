You are in an infinite 2D grid where you can move in any of the 8 directions :

	(x,y) to 
    (x+1, y), 
    (x - 1, y), 
    (x, y+1), 
    (x, y-1), 
    (x-1, y-1), 
    (x+1,y+1), 
    (x-1,y+1), 
    (x+1,y-1) 
You are given a sequence of points and the order in which you need to cover the points. 
Give the minimum number of steps in which you can achieve it. You start from the first point.

Example :

Input : [(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)]
Output : 2

IMP: to covert integer to positive number
a = abs(a);

Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits,
add 1 to the number ( increment the number represented by the digits ).
The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.
Example:
If the vector has [1, 2, 3]
the returned vector should be [1, 2, 4]
as 123 + 1 = 124.

<3>
DONE
Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.

For example:
Given the array [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
the contiguous subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
For this problem, return the maximum sum.

<NOT_IMP>
Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).
You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.
Example 1:
Given intervals [1,3],[6,9] insert and merge [2,5] would result in [1,5],[6,9].
Example 2:
Given [1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16], insert and merge [4,9] would result in [1,2],[3,10],[12,16].
This is because the new interval [4,9] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
Make sure the returned intervals are also sorted.

Given an m x n matrix of 0s and 1s, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0.
Do it in place.

Solution Approach:
Define two array each one for row and col.
Traverse through the matrix and set value of array row[r]=1 and col[c]=1 if A[r][c]==0,

Then again traverse to matrix row and check if row[r]==1 if so then set A[r][c]=0
Same for col[].

void setZeroes(int** A, int n11, int n12) {
    	
    int i;
	int j;

	int* r = (int*)calloc(n11, sizeof(int));
	int* c = (int*)calloc(n12, sizeof(int));
	//int *r = (int*)calloc(n11, sizeof(int)), *c = (int*)calloc(n12, sizeof(int));
	for (i = 0; i < n11; i++)
	{
		for (j = 0; j < n12; j++)
		{
			if (A[i][j] == 0)
			{
				r[i] = c[j] = 1;
	}}}
	for (i = 0; i < n11; i++)

You are given a read only array of n integers from 1 to n.
Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing.
Return A and B.
Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
Note that in your output A should precede B.

e.g. Arr[]={2,4,1,4,5}	: here 3 is missing and 4 is came twise
So output should be A=4 and B=3

Solution Approach:
Calculate below values:
SumA (SumOfArrElements)			= 2+4+1+4+5		
SumA2(SumOfSquareOfArrElements)	= 4+16+1+16+25
SumN (SumOfElementsFrom 1 to n)	= 1+2+3+4+5
SumN2 (SumOfSquareOf 1 to n)	= 1+4+9+16+25   :  SumN * (2*n + 1)/3

x = SumN - SumA
y = (SumN2 - SumA2)/x 

A = (y-x)/2
B = A + x

Given an unsorted integer array, find the first missing positive integer.
Example:
Given [1,2,0] return 3,

[-8, -7, -6] returns 1
Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and use constant space.

Find out the maximum sub-array of non negative numbers from an array.
The sub-array should be continuous. That is, a sub-array created by choosing the second and fourth element and skipping the third element is invalid.
Maximum sub-array is defined in terms of the sum of the elements in the sub-array. Sub-array A is greater than sub-array B if sum(A) > sum(B).

For example:
Given [3, 30, 34, 5, 9], the largest formed number is 9534330.

		Given a singly linked list, determine if its a palindrome. Return 1 or 0 denoting if its a palindrome or not, respectively.
		http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/function-to-check-if-a-singly-linked-list-is-palindrome/
		Method 1:
			Traverse Link list and store elements into STACK
			then compare element one by one from STACK and LinkList.
		Method 2:
			Find out the mid of LinkList.(traverse tree with slow ptr and fast ptr - slow = slow->next and fast=fast->next->next)
			in these way when our fast reached to the end of tree slow pointer will point to the middle ptr.
			Ten reverse second half.

	</3>
	<4>
		Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. 
		The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists, and should also be sorted.
		For example, given following linked lists :
		  5 -> 8 -> 20 
		  4 -> 11 -> 15
		The merged list should be :
		4 -> 5 -> 8 -> 11 -> 15 -> 20

	Cases to be test:
	1. if rotate number is bigger than the size of list.
	2. If list have only one element.
	3. If list is empty.

		Return : True or 1 
		Input 2 : 
			 3
			/
		   2
		  /

		Invert the Binary Tree

		Given a binary tree, invert the binary tree and return it. 
		Look at the example for more details.

		Example : 
		Given binary tree

			 1
		   /   \
		  2     3
		 / \   / \
		4   5 6   7
		invert and return

			 1
		   /   \
		  3     2
		 / \   / \
		7   6 5   4
		
		Approach:
		<!--
			TreeNode* invertTree(TreeNode *root) 
			{
				if (!root) return root;
				root->left = invertTree(root->left);
				root->right = invertTree(root->right);
				TreeNode *temp = root->left;
				root->left = root->right;
				root->right = temp;
				return root;
			}

		Kth Smallest Element In Tree
		
		Given a binary search tree, write a function to find the kth smallest element in the tree.
		Example :
		Input : 
		  2
		 / \
		1   3

		and k = 2
		Return : 2
		As 2 is the second smallest element in the tree.
		
		Approach:
			As given tree is a binary search tree that means all elementrs in left sub-tree is smaller than root.
			If there are less than k elements ar lest sub-tree then only we need to look into right side of the tree.

		Redundant Braces

		Write a program to validate if the input string has redundant braces?
		Return 0/1 
		 0 -> NO 1 -> YES 

		Input will be always a valid expression
		and operators allowed are only + , * , - , /
		Example:
		((a + b)) has redundant braces so answer will be 1
		(a + (a + b)) doesn't have have any redundant braces so answer will be 0

		Nearest Smaller Element

		Given an array, find the nearest smaller element G[i] for every element A[i] in the array such that the element has an index smaller than i.

		More formally,
		G[i] for an element A[i] = an element A[j] such that 
			j is maximum possible AND 
			j < i AND
			A[j] < A[i]
		Elements for which no smaller element exist, consider next smaller element as -1.

		Example:
		<!--
		Input : A : [4, 5, 2, 10]
		Return : [-1, 4, -1, 2]

		Example 2:

		Input : A : [3, 2, 1]
		Return : [-1, -1, -1]
		-->
		
		Approach:
		<!--
			stack<int> st;
			vector<int> res;
			res.resize(A.size());
			int len = A.size();
			int i = 0;

			while (i < len)
			{
				while (!st.empty() && st.top() >= A[i]) 
					st.pop();

				if (st.empty())
				{
					res[i] = -1;
					
				}
				else
				{
					res[i]=st.top();
				}
				st.push(A[i]);
				i++;
			}

			return res;

		Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

		Example :
		Given [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1], return 6.
		
		The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1].
		In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
		
		Approach:
		<!--
			Fun(int* A, int n)
			{
				int left = 0, right = n-1;
				int maxleft=0, maxright = 0;
				int res=0;
				while(left <= right)
				{
					if(A[left] <= A[right])
					{
						if(A[left] > maxleft)
							maxleft = A[left];
						else
							res += maxleft - A[left];
					}
					else
					{
						if(A[right] > maxright)
							maxright = A[right];
						else
							res += maxright - A[right];
					}
				}
				return res;
			}

		Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
		
		<!--
		stack<int> elementStack;
        stack<int> minimumStack;
        int minElement = -1;
		
		void push(int x) {
            elementStack.push(x);
            if(elementStack.size() == 1 || x <= minElement) {
                minimumStack.push(x);
                minElement = x;
            } 
        }

        void pop() {
            if (elementStack.top() == minElement) {
                minimumStack.pop();
                if (!minimumStack.empty()) {
                    minElement = minimumStack.top();
                } else {
                    minElement = -1;
                }
            }
            elementStack.pop();
        }
