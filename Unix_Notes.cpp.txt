chroot
A chroot on Unix operating systems is an operation that changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and its children. 
A program that is run in such a modified environment cannot name files outside the designated directory tree
This modified environment is known as “chroot jail” or “jailed directory”. Some root user and privileged process are allowed to use chroot command.


$ mkdir $HOME/jail
$ mkdir -p $HOME/jail/{bin, lib64}
$ cd $HOME/jail
Copy /bin/bash and /bin/ls into $HOME/jail/bin/ location using cp command:
$ cp -v /bin/{bash, ls} $HOME/jail/bin
Use ldd command to print shared libraries:
$ ldd /bin/bash

Copy required libraries into $HOME/jail/lib64/ location using cp command:
cp -v libraries/displayed/by/above/command $HOME/jail/lib64

Similarly, copy the libraries of ls command into $HOME/jail/lib64 location.

Finally, chroot into your mini-jail:
$ sudo chroot $HOME/jail /bin/bash
Now user sees $HOME/jail directory as its root directory. This is a great boost in the security.

File System
============
	ext      is  an  elaborate  extension of the minix filesystem.  It has
                 been completely superseded  by  the  second  version  of  the
                 extended  filesystem  (ext2)  and  has  been removed from the
                 kernel (in 2.1.21).

       ext2      is the high performance disk filesystem  used  by  Linux  for
                 fixed  disks as well as removable media.  The second extended
                 filesystem was designed  as  an  extension  of  the  extended
                 filesystem (ext).  See ext2 (5).

       ext3      is  a  journaling version of the ext2 filesystem.  It is easy
                 to switch back and forth between ext2  and  ext3.   See  ext3
                 (5).

       ext4      is   a   set   of  upgrades  to  ext3  including  substantial
                 performance  and   reliability   enhancements,   plus   large
                 increases  in  volume,  file, and directory size limits.  See
                 ext4 (5).

       hpfs      is the High  Performance  Filesystem,  used  in  OS/2.   This
                 filesystem  is  read-only  under  Linux  due  to  the lack of
                 available documentation.
			
			
Sticky-bit
----------
what if an user accidentally or deliberately deletes (or rename) a file created by some other user in this directory?
Well, to avoid these kind of issues, the concept of sticky bit is used.

Passwd file
The password file stores local accounts of the system. It is a readable text file and uses colons (:) to separate the fields. 
In this file the account names, identifiers, and other descriptive fields are stored

x => In passwd file x means password is in shadow file



Shadow file
Like the passwd file, the /etc/shadow file inherits most of the same fields and values:
 the password is not stored in /etc/passwd, but in /etc/shadow. It is stored as a long string of characters,
 which is a combination of the hashing algorithm, optional salt applied, and the hashed password itself.

Permissions of /etc/shadow
	[root@arch01 ~]# ls -l /etc/shadow
	-rw------- 1 root root 823 Dec 7 19:59 /etc/shadow
