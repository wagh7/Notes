chroot
A chroot on Unix operating systems is an operation that changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and its children. 
A program that is run in such a modified environment cannot name files outside the designated directory tree

Big Endian : move left to right
little Endian: move right to left

Least significant byte store in the sequence left to right in Big Endian. 
Least significant byte store in the sequence right to left in Little Endian.


grep:
>grep "string" file.txt
grep -i   : ignore case for matching


lsmod: to check module present
>lsmod | grep "sis"

>ps -aux

>ps -ef | grep sis

>ls -hl
	to check the size oh file

Find
====
find . -name pro\*
All files in the current directory starting with “pro” are listed.

run gdb with code dump:
gdb test core_dump_file

To find core dump file:
> find / -name "*core.*"
Typical name of the coredump is core.$PID


how to generate a core dump for a hung process, the answer is
>gcore <pid>

if gcore is not available on your system then
>kill -ABRT <pid>

ulimit -c unlimited

fedora 18 abrt program is storing core dumps in /var/spool/abrt/ instead of /var/cache/abrt


File System
============
	ext      is  an  elaborate  extension of the minix filesystem.  It has
                 been completely superseded  by  the  second  version  of  the
                 extended  filesystem  (ext2)  and  has  been removed from the
                 kernel (in 2.1.21).

       ext2      is the high performance disk filesystem  used  by  Linux  for
                 fixed  disks as well as removable media.  The second extended
                 filesystem was designed  as  an  extension  of  the  extended
                 filesystem (ext).  See ext2 (5).

       ext3      is  a  journaling version of the ext2 filesystem.  It is easy
                 to switch back and forth between ext2  and  ext3.   See  ext3
                 (5).

       ext4      is   a   set   of  upgrades  to  ext3  including  substantial
                 performance  and   reliability   enhancements,   plus   large
                 increases  in  volume,  file, and directory size limits.  See
                 ext4 (5).

       hpfs      is the High  Performance  Filesystem,  used  in  OS/2.   This
                 filesystem  is  read-only  under  Linux  due  to  the lack of
                 available documentation.
			
			
Sticky-bit
----------
what if an user accidentally or deliberately deletes (or rename) a file created by some other user in this directory?
Well, to avoid these kind of issues, the concept of sticky bit is used.
