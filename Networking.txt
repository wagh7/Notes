Google.com : domain name
DNS: domain name server
	It has IP address for each domain name

::HTTP::
HTTP is a TCP protocol.
It is connection oriented but stateless.
-Each time client request to the server new connection been created.
-Each time server response connection deleted. And Server ready to accept connection from different client.
This is because server handdled millons of request thats why it dont want to 
be reserved for specific client on any specific time.
And also server dont want to hold resources by specific client.


::SSL:: Secure Socket Layer Protocol
SSL Certificate
SSL uses 3 keys: private/public/session key

SSL dump???

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server 
and a client—typically a web server (website) and a browser, 
or a mail server and a mail client (e.g., Outlook).
SSL allows sensitive information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, and login credentials to be transmitted securely. 
All browsers have the capability to interact with secured web servers using the SSL protocol. However, the browser and the server need what is called 
an SSL Certificate to be able to establish a secure connection.


1. Browser connects to a web server (website) secured with SSL (https). Browser requests that the server identify itself.
2. Server sends a copy of its SSL Certificate, including the server’s public key.
3. Browser checks the certificate root against a list of trusted CAs and that the certificate is unexpired, unrevoked, and that its 
common name is valid for the website that it is connecting to. If the 	browser trusts the certificate, it creates, encrypts, 
and sends back a symmetric session key using the server’s public key.
4. Server decrypts the symmetric session key using its private key and sends back an acknowledgement encrypted with the session key 
to start the encrypted session.
5. Server and Browser now encrypt all transmitted data with the session key.


You enter a URL into a web browser
The browser looks up the IP address for the domain name via DNS
The browser sends a HTTP request to the server
The server sends back a HTTP response

Terminology
------------
Port No
	A port number is a way to identify a specific process to which an Internet or other network message is to be forwarded 
	when it arrives at a server. For the Transmission Control Protocol and the 	User Datagram Protocol, 
	a port number is a 16-bit integer that is put in the header appended to a message unit.
	
	To identify the services/process. Each service/process(e.g. oracle/sql) runs on unique port number.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TCP AND UDP. 
	TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is connection oriented, whereas UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is connection-less. 
	This means that TCP tracks all data sent, 		
	requiring acknowledgment for each octet (generally).
		
	HTTP - 80 
	SMTP - 25

IP Address
	Public IP: Need to purchase
	Private IP: free of cost
	
	IPv4:
		32-bit
		Unicast
		Multicast
		Broadcast
	IPv6:
		128-bit
		Unicast
		Multicast
		Anycast(one to closet)
		
	IPv4:
	32-bit: 8.8.8.8
	Total address: 2 to the power 32
	
	class-A : N.H.H.H : Total IPs : 2 to the power 24(8.8.8)
		Address: 1-127
	class-B : N.N.H.H : Total IPs : 2 to the power 16(8.8)
		Address: 128-191
	class-C : N.N.N.H : Total IPs : 2 to the power 8(8)
		Address: 192-223
	class-D : use for multicast operation
		Address: 224-239
	class-E : use for research/Development
		Address: 240-255


	Loop back address:
	127.0.0.1
		
	Subnetting
	==========
	
	Subnet Mask for class A: /8    : i.e. 8-bit for network 
	Subnet Mask for class B: /16
	Subnet Mask for class C: /24
	
	In subnetting network bit extend.
	In subnetting subnet mask will change:
	
	e.g. 
	/9 subnet mask will: 255.128.0.0 (comes under class A)
	/10 ->  255.192.0.0
	/23 ->  255.255.254.0   (comes under class B)
	
	in subnetting we add bits to network bits.
	like: In case of /9, one bit is extra in /8. That means 1 bit add into network bit.  
			And that one bit is Most significant bit. i.e. 2 to the power 7 = 128.
			and that why subnetting mask for /9 will be 255.128.0.0
			
	Network ID:
		The first id will be network id which represent network.(e.g. 255.168.1.0)
		So we can not assign network id to any machine.
		Router store network id instead of storing all ip in that network.
	Broadcast ID:
		This ip is used to send to all devices. (e.g. 255.168.1.255)
		This IP also we can not assign to any devices.
		
		
	e.g. If we need to 40 IP then we will use class C(having 255 ips).
	But if we use directly(without subnetting) then 255-40 IPs will waste.
	So we apply subnetting.
		2 rest to power 6 = 64 (so 40 covers into 64 range)
		We can divide 255 into 4 blocks(subnet) each of 64.
		class C : 255.255.255.0 /24
	How to calculate network bit:
		For 40, 2 rest to power 6 = 64 is sufficient,
		That means out of total 8 bit we only required 6 bit, so rest of 2(8-2) bits we can add to to network bit,
			So network bit for clss C will be 24+2 = 26.
		i.e. 255.255.255.0 /26

Network Topology
	BUS
		It transmits data only in one direction.
		Every device is connected to a single cable

		Advantages of Bus Topology:
			It is cost effective.
			Cable required is least compared to other network topology.
			Used in small networks.
			It is easy to understand.
			Easy to expand joining two cables together.
		Disadvantages of Bus Topology:
			Cables fails then whole network fails.
			If network traffic is heavy or nodes are more the performance of the network decreases.
			Cable has a limited length.
			It is slower than the ring topology.
	RING
		It is called ring topology because it forms a ring as each computer is connected to another computer, 
		with the last one connected to the first. Exactly two neighbors for each device.

		-A number of repeaters are used for Ring topology with large number of nodes, 
			because if someone wants to send some data to the last node in the ring topology with 100 nodes, 
			then the data will have to pass through 99 nodes to reach the 100th node. 
			Hence to prevent data loss repeaters are used in the network.
		-The transmission is unidirectional, but it can be made bidirectional by having 2 connections between each Network Node, 
			it is called Dual Ring Topology.
		-In Dual Ring Topology, two ring networks are formed, and data flow is in opposite direction in them. 
			Also, if one ring fails, the second ring can act as a backup, to keep the network up.
		-Data is transferred in a sequential manner that is bit by bit. 
			Data transmitted, has to pass through each node of the network, till the destination node.

		Disadvantages of Ring Topology:
			Troubleshooting is difficult in ring topology.
			Adding or deleting the computers disturbs the network activity.
			Failure of one computer disturbs the whole network.
	STAR
		-In this type of topology all the computers are connected to a single hub through a cable. 
			This hub is the central node and all others nodes are connected to the central node.
		-Every node has its own dedicated connection to the hub.
		-Hub acts as a repeater for data flow.
		-Can be used with twisted pair, Optical Fibre or coaxial cable.
		Advantages of Star Topology:
			-Fast performance with few nodes and low network traffic.
			-Hub can be upgraded easily.
			-Easy to troubleshoot.
			-Easy to setup and modify.
			-Only that node is affected which has failed, rest of the nodes can work smoothly.
		Disadvantages of Star Topology:
			-Cost of installation is high.
			-Expensive to use.
			-If the hub fails then the whole network is stopped because all the nodes depend on the hub.
			-Performance is based on the hub that is it depends on its capacity
	MESH		
		It is a point-to-point connection to other nodes or devices. All the network nodes are connected to each other. 
		Mesh has n(n-1)/2 physical channels to link n devices.
		There are two techniques to transmit data over the Mesh topology, they are :
			Routing
				In routing, the nodes have a routing logic, as per the network requirements.
			Flooding
				In flooding, the same data is transmitted to all the network nodes, hence no routing logic is required.
		Advantages of Mesh Topology:
			-Each connection can carry its own data load.
			-It is robust.
			-Fault is diagnosed easily.
			-Provides security and privacy.
		Disadvantages of Mesh Topology:
			Installation and configuration is difficult.
			Cabling cost is more.
			Bulk wiring is required.
